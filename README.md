# Valentine's Day Scavenger Hunt

Open **index.html** in your browser (double-click or drag into a browser window). No server required.

## Personalize

- **Quiz answers:** Edit the `QUIZ_CONFIG` array at the top of `script.js` to change questions and accepted answers.
- **Timeline:** Edit the dates, captions, and image URLs in the "Memory Lane" section of `index.html`.
- **Love letter:** Replace the text inside the `.letter-body` paragraph in `index.html`.

## Music

Place a piano (or any) track named **music.mp3** in this folder. Background music will try to start after the vault is unlocked; use the play/pause button in the top-right if your browser blocks autoplay.

## Files

- `index.html` — structure and content
- `styles.css` — layout and visuals
- `script.js` — counter, quiz, confetti, audio
- `music.mp3` — add your own file
